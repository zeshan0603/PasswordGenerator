This is a JS Project which allows user to generate two passwords. This was completely built from scratch and the idea was taken from a tutorial. 
It was a solo project and not a code along. 
The extra feature here is that the user can input the length of the password.
It can be used in multiple websites with changing the design as per the website requirements keeping the JS functionality part same.
